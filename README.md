# YelpCamp

YelpCamp is a web application that acts as a small-scaled Yelp clone designed specifically for Campgrounds. Users can view campgrounds, leave a review for campgrounds, and create a campground if they own one. Authors of campgrounds can edit, update, and delete their campgrounds.

This is a project that I made while learning about web development through [this course on Udemy.](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/) I started learning web development through this course in August 2020, and finished this course and the project with it as of June 2021.
